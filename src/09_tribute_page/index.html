                <h3>What made Wojtek famous?</h3>
                <p> Wojtek was a Syrian brown bear who lived from 1942 to 1963. He became famous when he was adopted by Polish soldiers during World War II.
                <p>
                <h3>How did he end up with the Polish soldiers?</h3>
                <p>He was a young cub when his mother was shot by hunters. He was found in the mountains of Iran by a young boy who then sold him to a group of Polish soldiers who were in the country after being evacuated from the from the Soviet Union. To make ends meet and get around, he was enlisted as a soldier with the rank of Private and later promoted to Corporal.</p>
                <h3>Was he really a soldier?</h3>
                <p>Yes. He went to Italy with most of the II Corps, working with the 22nd Artillery Supply Company. During
                    the
                    Battle of Monte Cassino in 1944, Wojtek helped move crates of ammunition and became a bit of a
                    celebrity
                    with visiting Allied generals and statesmen. After the war, he was discharged from the Polish Army
                    and
                    lived out the rest of his life at the Edinburgh Zoo in Scotland.</p>
